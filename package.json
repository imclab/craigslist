  "readme": "# Fetch Craigslist Listings in Node.js\n\nGiven that places in the Bay Area fill up so quickly, I made this to notify me whenever anything new was posted for a search I previously made on Craigslist. This was also an experiment integrating with Twilio (https://gist.github.com/4077346).\n\n> Note: Craigslist doesn't provide an API, and they don't want commerical apps accessing their site in an \"API-like way\" unless you ask their permission manually. So this lib should only be used for personal fun.\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install craigslist\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n``` javascript\nvar craigslist = require('craigslist');\n\n// this parses the HTML list, which doesn't include things like images and geo coordinates\ncraigslist.getList('http://auburn.craigslist.org/apa/', function(error, listings) {\n  listings.forEach(function(listing) {\n    listing.title;\n    listing.description;\n    listing.url;\n    listing.cities;\n    // ...\n  });\n\n  // for each listing, you can fetch the details (from actual listing html page on craigslist)\n  craigslist.getListing(listing[0], function(error, listing) {\n    listing.publishedAt;\n    listing.coverImage;\n    listing.images;\n    listing.coordinates;\n    listing.dogsAllowed;\n    listing.catsAllowed;\n    // .. see source\n  });\n});\n```\n",
